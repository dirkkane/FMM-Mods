Name=Revamped MOAR Animation
Author=Minelelol
Version=1.0
Desc=Add MOAR and REVAMPS the weapons first person animation for both SPARTANS and ELITES. This mod adds feature such as: More Melee Animation for Spartans and Elites, Brings back the Hard Landing animation for Spartan and Elite ( Even when dual wielding! ), Longer falling animation ( Now last around 30 seconds on the base mod ), Different pickup animation for certains weapons for spartans and elites, REVAMPS Pre existing animation for both spartans and elites, primarily the sprint animation. Best part about it? it's all cosmetic so nothing changes in gameplay ( I HOPE )
